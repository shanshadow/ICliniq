## Modules
1. [Chatbot](#chatbot)
2. [File Storage](#file-storage)
3. [OCR](#ocr)
4. [Tabular OCR](#tabular-ocr)
5. [Translator](#translator)
6. [Filtering and Searching](#filtering-and-searching)

## Chatbot
Current Status:
1. Basic funcationality done
2. Can handle multiligual input and resond in the input language

Next Step:
1. Implement a RAG model

Remarks:
- phi-4 model from LMStudio


## File Storage
Current Status:
1. Can store and retrieve data from sqlite3 db based on username and filename
2. Can read store multiple input filetypes

Next Step:
1. Implement structured file storage
2. Ensure consistent storage and retrieval in both sqlite3 and MongoDB

Remarks:
- Uses both MongoDB and sqlite3


## OCR
Current Status:
1. Able to successfully read charecters from the file

Next Step:
1. Try ti extract the structure of the table within the same module
2. Improve accuracy on the model
3. Implement an ML or DL model for OCR

Remarks:
- Uses tressaract installed locally on the system


## Tabular OCR
Current Status:
1. Able to extract the structure of any table
2. Cannot extract the data from the table

Next Step:
1. Try improving data extraction
2. Try to create a un-structured data. Eg. Like reports and text summaries

Remarks:
- Uses Paddle OCR module


## Translator
Current Status:
1. Uses google translate
2. Use a set of prefed languages

Next Step:
1. Implement a local ML model for translation

Remarks:
- Try testing the model for flexibilyt and accuracy


## Filtering and Searching
Current Status:
1. Done using pandas
2. Able to handle complex querries and filtering criteria
3. Reformat to fint into module with file initialization and column exception handling

Next Step:
1. Inegration with both MongoDB and sqlite database
2. Integration with RAG model ( Chatbot )

Remarks:
- Completed for basic funcitonality
